      <h1>Black Rock Caravan</h1>
      <h3>June 28–31: An expedition to the most peaceful spot in the universe.</h3>
      <p></p>
      
      <p>Greetings traveler. Are you human? Do you experience stress and difficulty? Do you lack purpose, wondering if there's something… <b>bigger</b>… <i>out there??</i></p>
      
      <p>Well, there is. Something huge. And white. And flat, dusty, mildly alkaline, and utterly surreal. It's called The Playa, and it's a magical place.</p>
    </box>

      <h2>The Playa??</h2>
    
      <p>Far to the east lies a land called Nevada. In a previous life, Nevada was a dank-ass sea world. But years of failure to moisturize and sunscreen avoidance have left it like this:</p>

      <p>The playa today is much less sea but no less dank. Nevada offers hundreds of these grand locations—but the Black Rock Desert is the grandest of all. 200 square miles of glorious flat nothing, surrounded by majestic blank mountains, as if god herself took an edible and forgot to finish this part.</p>
      
      <p>But it's not all empty. You'll see scrub:</p>

      <p>Don't want no scrub? How about rocks, big ones:</p>
      
      <img src="/black_rock_peak.jpeg"></img>
    
      <p>Still not inspired? What about hot springs. Everybody loves those bitches:</p>
      
      <img src="/hot_spring_overview.jpeg"></img>
      
      <p>Ha! I knew that one would do it! Let's get down to business then.</p>

      <h2>What should I bring?</h2>
      
      <p>Clothing, for sure. NUDITY IS IMMORAL.</p>
      
      <p>Expect <b>cold</b> desert nights and <b>hot</b> desert days, with temperatures from 40° to 100°. A few suggestions:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Warm pants</li>
        <li>Long shirts</li>
        <li>Light hiking pants</li>
        <li>T-shirt</li>
        <li>A jacket+hoodie</li>
        <li>Sturdy shoes</li>
        <li>Flip-flops</li>
        <li>Bathing suit</li>
        <li>Sunglasses</li>
        <li>Your trusty hat</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Additionally, in the non-clothing department, I strongly recommend:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Towel</li>
        <li>Day pack</li>
        <li>Water bottles/Camelback</li>
        <li>Tent</li>
        <li>Sleeping bag+pad</li>
        <li>Teddy bear or other comfort object, the desert is scary af</li>
        <li>A good playlist</li>
        <li><b>Camping cooking supplies</b> (mine are limited!)</li>
        <li>Sunscreen</li>
        <li>Your favorite snacks</li>
        <li>Body armor</li>
        <li>At least one parachute</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We get groceries on the way, but if you want anything special I encourage you to think of it now. I try to buy as much as possible from the solitary local store in Gerlach—the town by the playa—but it's basically a well-equipped 7-Eleven. Don't expect to see a grocery store any farther than Reno.</p>

      <h2>How Do I Get There?</h2>
      
      <p><b>Friday, 5/28, at Noon-thirty</b> we will rally the caravan by the east-side <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DosYmxNQ8UXqrR6T9">Berkeley Bowl</a>. That's the one by Ashby BART, for you degenerate public transporters.</p>
      
      <p>At this time and location you will be issued your walkie-talkie and soft caramel. You may only eat one of these, but which one is at your discretion.</p>
      
      <p>After that it is a short lil' 5-hour drive to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RihM3VMqAP3hejgMA">Gerlach, NV</a>:</p>

      <p>Expect to lose cell service once we reach the playa. I get very limited reception with Verizon but generally no LTE. However, Gerlach has okay-ish reception and Bruno's Country Club in has wifi.</p>
      
      <p>Ok y'all, I think that's it. Godspeed and see you soon!</p>
